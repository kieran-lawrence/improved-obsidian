# Improved Obsidian

Improved Obsidian was created because vanilla Minecraft has little to no use for Obsidian.

It was on this thought I built Improved Obsidian, to enhance Minecraft by adding a vanilla-like experience but with lots of cool additions.

## In this mod you will find:

- A new tier of weapons & armour, stronger than Netherite
- New crafting stations for unleashing the potential of Obsidian
- Various decorative blocks, all based around Obsidian
